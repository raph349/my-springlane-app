SpringLane is a Plug&Play retail technology solution that eliminates friction in textile stores by combining real-time inventory automation with a seamless mobile self-checkout experience. On the B2B side, SpringLane’s intelligent anti-theft tags connect directly to the retailer’s IMS to ensure accurate stock updates, smart replenishment, and performance tracking. On the B2C side, its mobile app lets customers scan, pay, and unlock the connected anti-theft tags instantly, without passing through traditional checkouts. The result: faster operations, more available staff, improved merchandising, and a fluid, frustration-free shopping experience. 
It’s important to note that the current version is an MVP. In real deployment, the SpringLane App will not be a web application but a native mobile app, as the solution requires access to the smartphone’s NFC reader to interact with the SpringLane anti-theft tag. This hardware integration is essential to allow customers to scan, pay, and unlock items directly from their phone—something that would not be feasible on a computer. The web prototype simply serves as a functional demonstration of the user flow while the native mobile version is developed.
